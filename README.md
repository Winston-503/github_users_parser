## Setup and Usage

See the detailed tutorial on [Medium]() or on [GitLab]() directly.

- Make sure you have Python and needed libraries installed. Otherwise [install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install the libraries:
    - You should create a virtual environment (although it is not necessary), activate it, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 
    - You can also install these libraries using conda or pip directly. You can see the list of libraries in the `requirements.txt` file.
- Open `github_parser.py` file with any text editor and set your parameters in the **Setting parameters** section, **on lines 165-194**. Don't forget to save the file.
- Then run the program with `python github_parser.py` command.

To explore code or to make your experiments see `github_parser.ipynb` notebook. It contains the same code as python script.
